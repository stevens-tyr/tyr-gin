* Tyr-Gin
** Why?
The purpose of this is to centralize some features common to a gin service 
that we might use in our microservices. This way each microservice does not 
need to re-implement features. Such as jwt functions, logging and etc.
** Features
1. Logging
2. JWT
3. Easy way to add endpoints.
** Contributing

4. Make your changes.
5. Run make all to fmt, lint, and test code.
6. Make a merge request.
** Todo
1. Add testing(ci if I can figure out how gitlab works with that).
2. Add Implementation of jwt.
3. Add mongodb connection.
4. Add logging levels.
5. Check environment variables for log level.
