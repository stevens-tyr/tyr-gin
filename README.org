* Tyr-Gin
** Why?
The purpose of this is to centralize some features common to a gin service
that we might use in our microservices. This way each microservice does not
need to re-implement features. Such as jwt functions, logging and etc.
** Features
1. Logging
2. JWT
3. Easy way to add endpoints.
** Setup the Environment
The following environmental variables are used:
#+begin_src
MONGO_URI=<URI OF MongoDB>
DB_NAME=<Name of Database to use>
LOG_FILE=<Name of log file (log.json by default)>
JWT_SECRET=<Secret used for JWT encryption>
JWT_REALM=<Realm for JWT (different for prod/dev)>
#+end_src
Within this repo, there is an example .env file that is used for testing purposes,
when using this package, place a .env file within the root folder where you setup
the router.
