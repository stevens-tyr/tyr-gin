* Tyr-Gin
** Why?
The purpose of this is to centralize some features common to a gin service 
that we might use in our microservices. This way each microservice does not 
need to re-implement features. Such as jwt functions, logging and etc.
** Features
1. Logging
2. JWT
3. Easy way to add endpoints.
